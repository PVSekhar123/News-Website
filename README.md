Project
=========
Frontend of News Website

Tech Stack
=========
HTML and CSS is used to make frontend. I also used Font Awesome, Google Fonts and Bootstrap.

Explanation
=========
index.html is the main file(homepage) and login_page.html is for login page. 'css' folder contains index.css for styling of index.html and login_page.css for styling of login page.

Home page consists of navigation, welcome note, space for advertisements, main body and footer section. Navigation has different option(with hovering effect) which takes you to respective sections of homepage, login option and search option. On clicking login image, it directs you to login page. Navigation converts to toggle menu, when the screen width is sufficiently less. Welcome note has hovering effect. Main body is divided into news section and space for advertisements. News section is divided into 5 sections:Breaking News, Sports News, National News, World News and Business News. Each section has related articles(with photo and title), which on clicking takes you to website having complete article. For now 'prev' and 'next' button of slides of these 5 sections are not working properly, you can do 'shift+mouse wheel'(in computer) and horizontal sliding(for touch screen) to scroll between slides. At the bottom, there is footer which contains general info, useful links and subscribe option.

Notable features
=========
Website has a favicon and title. Website is responsive. Navigation changes to toggle menu as screen width decreases.
